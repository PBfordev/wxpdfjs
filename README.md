Proof of concept of using [Mozilla JavaScript PDF viewer](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js) in a wxWidgets application.

Please notice that:
1. This does not seem like a good idea in general.
2. Mozilla explicitly asks to not use the viewer as is, but modify it.

Requires wxWidgets 3.3. Tested on Windows with wxWebViewEdge backend and Linux.
